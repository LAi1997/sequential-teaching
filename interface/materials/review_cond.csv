"Strategy 1 applies the BLUE STAR operator on boxes that differ by no more than one in the number of fruits contained
whereas Strategy 2 applies the BLUE STAR operator on boxes with a larger difference in the number of fruits contained.

If you used information you learned from the BLUE STAR operator for the PURPLE DIAMOND, which one of the two
strategies is the closest to your application of the BLUE STAR? (180 secs to answer)",materials/merge_sort/imgs/merge_train/optimal_merge.png,materials/merge_sort/imgs/merge_train/suboptimal_merge.png
