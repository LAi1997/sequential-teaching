Has CS degree,Has learned sort alg,Used sort alg,Strategy for sorting short number sets,Strategy for sorting long sets,Strategy of using blue star (merge) for purple diamond (sort),Blue star strategy 1 vs. blue star strategy 2
Yes,Yes,Quick sort,answered based on instruction and using weight balance,weight balanced,as i guessed the answer using weight bridge,answered by strategy 2
Yes,Yes,Quick sort,"compare a with others, then find weight higher than a and lower than a. then sort from weight lower than a and higher than a.","select any alphabet, for example c. compare c with others. then find weight lower than c and higher than c. sort the weights from lower than c and higher than c.",select any fruit and compare it with fruits on both sides. then sort it,strategy 2
Yes,Yes,I know of some of these sorts but I used Quick-Sort for this experiment.,"select a pivot fruit and then compare it to each of the fruit, moving the lighter fruits to the left and the heavier fruits to the right. continue with this method for each new pile until all the fruits are sorted.","select a pivot fruit and compare to each fruit, moving the lighter fruits to the left and the heavier fruits to the right. repeat the steps on the smaller piles until all fruits are sorted.","i did not use any information from the blue star operator as the two orange boxes were already pre-sorted so i knew which fruit was going into the conveyor belt simply by comparing. if anything, i knew i had to split the fruits into a ""heavier"" pile and a ""lighter"" pile somehow.",the closest one would probably be strategy 2.
Yes,Yes,I have used the Bubble-Sort  method to complete this experiment.,it is compared to its weight only based on its basis and not in any strategies.,the larger the number but it is down only using the amount of weight that every fruits take in its own to weight and we used to compare on the weighing machine to choose the correct answer.,the information that we gained is easily we can weight the fruits in the machines.,the blue star operator strategy 2  is more easier  than the first strategy.compartive
Yes,Yes,"Merge-Sort, Dictionary-Sort",start on the left and compare on my way to the right. then each new tomato i would compare with the middle of what i knew was sorted correctly and work my way left or right,"make a pile of what i knew for sure, and find each new fruit's place in that pile. ",i didn't use the strategy from the blue star because the blue star's way told me which order would come out of the box.,i used strategy number 2 a bit more i think.
Yes,Yes,JUST TRY TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE WITHIN A GIVEN TIMEFRAME ....,compare each one calculate the weight and move left to right one by one to arrange in a  increasing order ,compare the weight and arrange the order from left to right after comparing the weight of each subject,compare both side of weight and try to arrange the appropriate order ,i have used the strategy 1 
Yes,Yes,Bubble sort ,i compared weight and arranged based on the weight,based on the comparison result i arranged ,after comparing those i chose ,strategy 2 
Yes,Yes,Merge-Sort,bfaced,dbacfgejhi,badcfe,strategy 2
Yes,Yes,"I am familiar with Merge-sort. No, I did not used any sorting task in the experiment. ",adcebf,dfacjbiehg,through the conveyer belt.,strategy 1
Yes,Yes,No I didn't use any,"compare all to a and split into 2 groups left and right
then continue comparing the same way",i would compare all to a and split into to groups and i would continue doing so with the rest,empty,strategy 1
NO,NO,NO,compare the weights in weighng scale after that arrange the orders with small to high compare all the fruits,based on comparing i decide which friuit has more weight and which fruit has less weight,checking all the fruits which has weight which has less weight after that getting idea to solve the task,i use strategy 2 because it is easy for me to solve the task
NO,NO,I do not know any of the algorithms,i found out which was lighter and put them in order. i kept comparing until i found the right order,i compared each item to another then arranged them in ordre,i used the same methos for all items,i used closer to strategy two.
Yes,Yes,None,i compared groups of two fruits to determine their position compared to the others,i compared groups of two fruits to see their order compared to the others.,"i compared the first and last fruit for the two different boxes, and then order the boxes",i sometimes compared individual fruits and then compared them to the first and last of a group of fruits that i had the correct order for.
