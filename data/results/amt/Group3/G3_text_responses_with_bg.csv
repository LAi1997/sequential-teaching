Has CS degree,Has learned sort alg,Used sort alg,Strategy for sorting short number sets,Strategy for sorting long sets,Strategy of using blue star (merge) for purple diamond (sort),Blue star strategy 1 vs. blue star strategy 2
Yes,Yes,No,"check one fruit with other and arrange in order, then check from the 2nd fruit and arrange, do it for 2 or 3 times for the whole fruits.","compare each two fruits and arrange, then compare that group to other two fruits and arrange.","checking last fruit in first orange box to first fruit in the second box, then deciding the lesser weight fruit.",strategy 2.
Yes,Yes,"It's been 18 years since I learned them, but I think I was doing a bubble sort?  I'm not sure.  The only ones I don't know about are Dictionary, Bucket, Spider and Ticket.","i compared one at a time and sorted the list.  i apparently didn't do it well at points, i'm not sure what i did wrong.","i used the same method as described before, but most of the time didn't finish in the time limit.",i think it's just the same basic principle.  compare each and put them in order.,i think it was more like strategy 2.
Yes,Yes,no,would weigh all the fruits and arrange accordingly in increasing order of weight,will check the weight of few apples and then decide.,will add the lowest weight of fruit first,strategy 1
Yes,Yes,Merge-Sort,i set the fruits in increasing order,the task increasing is right to left,the star arranging the fruits in purple diamond,the fruits are increase the weight
Yes,Yes,Bubble - sort,i will weigh fruits from left to right each other and confirm the weight and arrange in order to pack.,empty,i use to compare the weight in order to arrange fruits in correct order. but its slightly difficult.,yes when fruits differ in numbers its slightly confused to weigh them and in arranging them.
NO,NO,"Dictionary sort, Merge sort",a d c b f e,e i h f b g c j d a,shipping crate,strategy 1
Yes,Yes,Merge -sort -yes,i started with the first one and worked over until i found a lighter one ,i started in the middle and worked each end systematically until all had been chosen ,i used the blue star to visualize the fruit on the conveyor belt as it dropped into the purple diamond to keep track of the fruit,strategy one 
Yes,Yes,No. But I was studied the above all algorithms but I was not remember now.,hard to arrange take long process time two or three comparison is ok for that method,very hard to arrange not easy to find the answer,its also hard but compare to another its ok,strategy 1 is applies the blue star
Yes,Yes,Insertion-Sort,the comparison was help me to arrange the fruits increasing order,the comparison was easy to compare the fruits weight,the blue star operator was very easy to arrange the fruits in purple diamond operator,i used strategy 1 for my decision making
