Yes,Yes,Insertion-sort,i arrange the fruits in increasing order,good,nice survey,inrasting survey
Yes,Yes,Quick-sort,i moved from 1st to the last fruit and then 1 by one,i started with e then i moved to g and one by one,i started with the purple diamond then i weighed the lightest on the blue star,strategy 1
Yes,Yes,I think I know what bubble sorting and insertion sorting are. I believe I was insertion sorting by the end.,"i compare a pair and arrange them, then use those ""points"" to compare and sort the rest. i think you can reduce the number of comparisons necessary by starting by comparing an unknown to something in the middle of the knowns. then you know which side it is on and you don't have to make any comparisons with the other side.","i think i just gave this answer for the last question. i just compare the unknowns to the knowns i have arranged in the correct order. i know i don't have to make the comparisons on the wrong side, so this reduces the number of comparisons made. (my ""star"" approach also relied on eliminated based on order","with the blue star operation, you don't have to compare things that you know are heavier/lighter based on their arranged order. by keeping the tracking the tentative order in purple, you can apply the same principle to reduce comparisons.","strategy 1, i think. you switch your line of comparisons between ""sides"" instead of one by one. i'm not sure i get this question, however."
Yes,Yes,none,comparisons to work out weight order,i didn't change my strategy. pair wise comparisons to work out order,i did not use it,strategy 2
Yes,Yes,"I know bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, quick sort. I mostly used insertion sort. ",compared two items and arranged in the order. i kept inserting the items by comparing with the neighboring items.,compared two items and sorted in an order.,i used the same approach.,strategy 1 is closer
Yes,Yes,I know ticket sort.,"i have compared the weight of one item with another item. based on the comparison, i have arranged the items accordingly.",i have measured the weights of items in the purple diamond and based on the weight i have arranged items.,"based on the instructions in purple diamond, i have arranged items. ",strategy 2 is highly applicable in my deciding factor. blue star in strategy 2 is effective in taking decision.
Yes,Yes,"I've used bubble sorts in the past, but it's been a long time since I've done it, so I can't really determine whether I've used any of these specific sorting algorithms during this experiment.","i will compare a to all the fruits from b to e, then move fruits smaller than a to the left of a and fruits bigger than a to the right of a. then i'll compare fruits from the fruits to the left of a to each of the fruits in that group until i find out which ones are bigger than the others, etc. i'll keep doing this until the fruits on the left side of a are sorted. after those are done, i'll sort the fruits on the right side of a.","i'll follow the same algorithm i used to sort the smaller pile of fruits, by finding all the fruits bigger than a and then putting those to the right of a, then finding the fruits smaller than a and putting those to the left of a. i'll then go about sorting the fruits bigger and smaller than b, and so on, until i finish sorting all the fruits.",i don't believe i used the information found from the blue star for arranging the fruits when using the purple diamond.,i don't believe i used what i learned from the blue star operator in my decisions regarding the purple diamond.
Yes,Yes,"Merge-Sort, Dictionary-Sort","compare new apple with middle apple of the row i knew was in order, and work my way either greater or lesser","compare new apple with middle apple of the row i knew was in order, and work my way either greater or lesser",find the lesser weight item from the two answers below where the order differs.,"each job entailed two different strategies for me, so they did not help eachother."
Yes,Yes,INSERTION SORT,thus apple that i ,"first compare e and a
then,i and d
then,h and j
then,f and c
then,b and g
","first find the middle fruit,then compare each other fruit to find the least o","fisrt , i had compared the fruit on orange box ,then find the less weight fruit and then compared with another orane box "
Yes,Yes,"Bubble sort, merge sort, insertion sort, quick sort. I used a naive approach of insertion sort.","compare fruits beginning with the leftmost fruit, moving the fruit right of the next fruit if it is heavier. otherwise, leave it in its position. continue this process until you reach the last fruit. once the pass is done, the rightmost fruit is sorted and may be omitted on further iterations. now, continue the process with the remaining subset. continue until sorted.","basically, apply insertion sort, despite it being inefficient. you begin by comparing elements, starting from the left and moving right, swapping elements if necessary. at the end of each pass, the rightmost element is sorted and removed from the unsorted list. continue until no items remain in the unsorted list.","i did not utilize this information to sort the lists later. in hindsight, though, a merge sort, as this depicted, would have been more efficient.",i did not utilize the information from the blue star operator to sort the list.
