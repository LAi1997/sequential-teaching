Has CS degree,Has learned sort alg,Used sort alg,Strategy for sorting short number sets,Strategy for sorting long sets,Strategy of using blue star (merge) for purple diamond (sort),Blue star strategy 1 vs. blue star strategy 2
Yes,Yes,no,compare the weights from left to right ,compare the weight difference from left to right,from conveyor belt,strategy 2 
NO,NO,No,i tried to weight the fruits in the least amount of moves possible. then i proceeded to put them in the correct order.,i tried to weigh the fruits in the last amount of moves to get the most accurate weights by comparison. then i put them in the correct order.,i learned that what i thought was the correct order was actually backwards so i tried to recite my answers as correctly as possible by using that method.,the main information i used was knowing that the order i needed to provide for answers was backwards from what felt normal. i learned this in the game.
Yes,Yes,"I'm still starting to learn Spider-Sort, however in this experiment I didn't apply anything.","organization facilitator, for those who like agility, it provides better performance. i didn't use it because i like to do it manually.","the longer the queue to organize the fruits, the better the purple diamond is usable, as it provides agility and organization.","the blue mat is a facilitator to understand which are the boxes with greater or lesser weights, while the purple diamond facilitates the organization in a more specific way, being the weight from the smallest to the largest of each apple.","i believe that strategy number two, despite being time consuming to apply, provides more precision in placing them in the order of weights, because of this, in my opinion, despite the delay, i prefer strategy 2."
Yes,Yes,I have learnt all the above except for Spider and Ticket sort. But it was a long time ago and I have forgotten them. I just went with the flow and figured out a strategy.,"1. compare two letters. place them in the middle in ascending order
2. pick next letter. compare with the extremes. place it on the left or right accordingly.
3. repeat for every letter until everything is sorted.",compare the extremes by choosing two letters. place further picked letters either on right or left based on the weight ,i used the purple diamond approach as it clicked to follow the rule of dividing the conveyor belt in halves.,strategy 2
Yes,Yes,,compare a and b. if a>b then check a and c. if c>a. then check c and d. if d>c then check d and f. if f>d then check f and e. if e>f then sorting is b a c d e f,empty,empty,empty
Yes,Yes,"I vaguely remember merge-sort, insertion-sort, quick-sort, bucket-sort, bubble-sort though my memory is hazy. I think my approach was most similar to insertion sort.","after i got to three fruits, i tried to compare the middle fruit and then compare the remaining half. it's a divide and conquer approach.",i compared to the middle fruit and then compared to the remaining half.,i didn't find it useful.,strategy 1
Yes,Yes,Bubble-sort ,i compared the weight and arranged it based on weight,based on weight i arranged after comparing ,to arrange it even ,i used strategy 2
